# Ball (About)
In the project I created an object(ball) and made it move. I made it to become more circular whenever it hits the corner.

## How to run
To run this program, you have to load the index.html file to your broswer. It'll start automatically once you loaded it. To re-start the program, you have to refresh the browser.

## Things to improve in the future
I'd like to add a button to add multiple balls that each ball randomly acts when hits the corner.
